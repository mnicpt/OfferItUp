I researched all of the image pickers I could find and none of them were worth using.  The top rated one had major memory issues, another crashed and the rest only provided the ability to choose multiple images which wasn't a requirement.  I chose not to use one because I wouldn't in a real world scenario.  Technically, it's not difficult to add the dependency as a pod and then use their class and API in place of the native image picker.
